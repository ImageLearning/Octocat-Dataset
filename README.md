# Photo Gallery Template

Clone this template repo, make sure the repo name is your domain name in the form of Domain.Extention *(we use the repo name as a variable in scripts so the script is expecting to find domain.extension)*. If you go with something else, you can always submit pull requests or fork [this action](https://github.com/pauliver/CSharp-Image-Action). 

Then add photos to the [/gallery/](./gallery/) folder and any subfolders you wish to create under it


The Sample website consists of some files and a few folders
- actions .yml file
- generated .json file
- folder to put your images in
- Ondex.md 

# Actions .yml file

# generated galleryjson.json file

# Folder to put the images in 

# Index.md 

The Index file 

# For your future ReadMe.md file
